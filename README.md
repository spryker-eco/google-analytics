Provides Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integration for Spryker. Tracks storefront search events (searches with results and zero-result searches) via `gtag`, and surfaces the collected data as search statistics dashboards in the Back Office using the GA4 Data API.

## Features

- Storefront TypeScript component that pushes `search_results` and `zero_search_results` events to GA4 via `gtag`, including store and locale as custom parameters
- Back Office **Search Statistics** section with three views: overview, Search Terms, and Zero Results
- Date range presets (last 24 hours / 7 days / 30 days) with per-store and per-locale filtering
- Paginated, sortable tables with minimum-count and keyword filtering
- Reads data from GA4 using a service account — no manual CSV export required
